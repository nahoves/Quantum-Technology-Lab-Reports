This repository contains my Lab python notebook reports from the Quantum Technology master course at KTH university.
We explored 4 experiments/subdomains :
- Quantum algorithms
- SQUIDs
- Squeezing
- Quantum erasure

Through the final assignement, I was able to study more thouroughly Quantum algorithms, and write a more substantial report about it which you can find on this page as well.
